# Smart Games

A system for creating contests in competetive programming with interactive tasks of a new type (duel tasks) in the Telegram bot interface.

## Duel Tasks
Unlike regular interactive tasks, in duel tasks the participants' solutions collide directly. Instead of interacting with a standard interactor, a participant's solution interacts with another participant's solution. Compliance with the interaction protocol is checked in the runner - an analogue of the interactor program in a regular task. At the same time, from the participant's point of view, the way the program is written is no different.

> An example of the implementation of the game Rock-Paper-Scissors can be found in the source files:

> - [Solutions files](run_files)

## How to write runners

```python
from run_files.runner import Solution
from run_files.runner import SolException

sol1 = Solution
sol2 = Solution


def run(sol1_name, sol2_name):
    global sol1, sol2
    try:
        sol1 = Solution(sol1_name, 1, 1)
        sol2 = Solution(sol2_name, 2, 1)
        
        #Here you describe all interactions via the output and read methods

    except SolException as e:
        sol1.proc.kill()
        sol2.proc.kill()
        if str(e) == sol1_name:
            return -1
        else:
            return -2

```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### The runner must return one of the following values:
> - 1 - player 1 wins
> - 2 - player 2 wins
> - -1 - player 1 violated the interaction protocol
> - -2 - player 2 violated the interaction protocol


# Running
- Run the app.py file, having previously specified the id of the admins in Telegram who will be able to add new tasks to the contest:
    ```bash
    python3 app.py
    ```

- Preliminarily create the token.txt file, in which you specify the token of your bot in Telegram. Also in the bot.py file, specify the address to the main page of the server where app.py is running. Run the bot:
    ```bash
    python3 bot.py
    ```

- To recalculate the points of the contest participants and update the results table, run [calculate_points.py](calculate_points.py):
    ```bash
    python3 calculate_points.py
    ```
